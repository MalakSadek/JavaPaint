# Java Paint
A Java program that has the same features as Microsoft Paint ðŸŽ¨ ðŸ’» (2019).

This GUI-based application implemented in Java and the `Java/FX` and `Java/Swing` libraries. It displays a canvas and a set of tools to allow the user to draw among a set of other features such as saving/loading canvases or syncing canvases with another user.

## Features:
* Draw lines, rectangles, squares, circles, triangles, ellipses, hexagons, octagons, and other polygons (specify number of sides)
* Fill the shapes with color, draw them as outlines only, change the stroke width and color
* Resize or move shapes after they are drawn
* Clear the canvas or change its background color
* Undo or redo any action
* Save the file (by serializing it) or load an existing file
* Connect to another user and sync canvases with them (each person gets all the other drawings the person has made added to their canvas)
